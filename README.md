# SettingsHelper [![RimWorld Alpha 19](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-Alpha%2019-brightgreen.svg)](http://rimworldgame.com/) [![Wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-Wiki-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/RimWorld-CCL-Reborn/SettingsHelper/wiki)

This helper is used to simplify working with settings GUIs. Extends `Listing_Standard` to have additional functionality.

## Features
- Works with labels and numericals for text fields, checkboxes, radioboxes, and sliders
- Add label lines
- Add list of radio boxes
- Add horizontal line
- Utilities for splitting rectangles
- Color picker utility for providing UI for picking a color (credits to KaimeV)

## Improvements
- Need more/better default values, parameters
- Radio boxes and other lists need more helpers

## Notes
- First version of this was ModWindowHelper which used it's own helper for keeping track of position in the UI.
